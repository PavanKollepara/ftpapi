Secure FTP API for Java
=======================

Introduction
------------

Secure FTP API for Java is a collection of Java classes that can be used in 
your Java applications to perform FTP related tasks with little or no effort. 
The Secure FTP API for Java implements all FTP functions as specified in the 
File Transfer Protocol specification, RFC 959. In addition, the Secured FTP 
API for Java implements FTP Security Extensions as specified in RFC 2228. This 
allows Java programs to communicate with FTP servers over a secured channel 
using the industry standard security mechanism, SSL.

One of the great demonstrations of Secure FTP API for Java is JFTP, a full 
featured, graphical FTP client with SSL support.
